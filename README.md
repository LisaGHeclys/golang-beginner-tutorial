# Golang Backend Tutorial - Beginner Level

Welcome! This repository documents my journey of learning how to create a backend using **Go (Golang)** by following a beginner-level tutorial. It's meant to serve both as a reference for myself and potentially a helpful guide for others who are just starting out.

## 📚 Tutorial Source

## 🛠️ What I Learned

This tutorial covered the foundational concepts of building a backend in Go, including:

- Installing and setting up Go

## 🚀 How to Run It Locally

### Prerequisites

- [Go installed](https://go.dev/dl/)
- (Optional) Postman or cURL to test API routes

### Steps

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/LisaGHeclys/golang-beginner-tutorial
cd golang-beginner-tutorial

# Run the server
go run server.go
```

The server should start at `http://localhost:8080`.

## 🤔 Why Go?

I wanted to explore Go for its performance, simplicity, and growing use in backend services. This tutorial was a great starting point to understand the basics and write idiomatic Go code.
